# Atomy Kumala Website

React-based web application for showcasing Compensation Plans, Code of Ethics, and Product Catalog. This project is built using React, React Router, and CSS Modules for component styling.

## 💡 Notes

All images are stored in the public/ folder and referenced using root-relative paths (/folder/file.ext) to ensure they load correctly across routes.

SubHeaders and Footer elements are controlled via props to allow per-page customization.

Interactive elements (cards, mobile menu) are implemented using React useState and useRef hooks.

## 📌 Future Improvements

Add dynamic product detail pages with routing based on product ID

Integrate API for product data

Implement search and filtering for Product Catalog

Add unit tests for interactive components
